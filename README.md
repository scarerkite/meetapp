### MeetApp

This was the 3rd and final project of the GA Web Development Immersive course. I enjoyed bringing together everything I had learned over the previous 12 weeks.

****

### Description

MeetApp allows users to create events so that everyone attending can access useful information in one place. You can update the address/map by finding your current location, and post updates for everyone to see. It was built in Rails 4 and uses the Bootstrap framework. The Google Maps API and geocoding are utilized and thereâ€™s an invitation system for both events and friends.
